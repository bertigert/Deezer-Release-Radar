# Deezer-Release-Radar
A script to view new releases of artist you follow, not the ones Deezer thinks you like. Deezers Release Playlist does not feature small artists and features artists you heard 2 times. This radar features only all artists you follow. Designed for the Desktop Browser version, supports both dark and white mode. Tested on Chrome/Firefox with Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey and Desktop Application on Windows.\

## Now also supported for the desktop application
Thanks to the [DeezMod](https://github.com/bertigert/DeezMod) project we can now easily use scripts within the desktop application. You can download the version for that script [here](https://github.com/bertigert/DeezMod/tree/main/plugins/release_radar)

## Note
Due to a bug in the Deezer API, some artists are bugged and dont return releases when having the "Features" checkbox enabled. This will hopefully be fixed on the server side, if not I will implement a fix manually, which would drastically reduce performance though.

## Functionality
- Adds a menu item right besides the notifications icon
- Allows you to limit the amount of displayed releases by amount or age or last scan time (highly recommended as the higher the age limit, the more requests we need to make)
- Lets you choose if you want to include Features, Singles, EPs, Albums
- Allows you to add new songs to a specified playlist (by ID), features a blacklist using regex to filter out songs with a specific name
- Allows you to seperate/hide Upcoming Releases
- Allows you to blacklist releases using regex
- Allows you to blacklist artists using their ID
- Allows you to open the releases in the desktop app
- Highly configurable
- Scans for new artists every day, songs on deezer get released at midnight UTC (idk tbh)
- Allows you to play songs directly from within the radar, view the cover images in 1920x1920 resolution, supports ajax loading of releases
- Note: When launching for the first time, all songs are considered new. It uses localstorage for cache and config.
